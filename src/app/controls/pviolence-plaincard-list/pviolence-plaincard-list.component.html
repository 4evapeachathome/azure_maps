    <h3>What is Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)?</h3>
    <p>
      Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is defined as behaviors by a current or former intimate 
      partner that cause physical, sexual, or psychological harm. This includes forms of 
      physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse, and controlling behaviors.

      to recurring and severe episodes that can last for many years.
