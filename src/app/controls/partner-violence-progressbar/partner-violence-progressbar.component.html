  <!-- Description Content -->
  <p>
    Level 3 abuse includes more severe actions such as the use of a weapon, choking, 
    or attempting to strangulate. Different forms of violence include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Intimate terrorism / patriarchal terrorism:</strong> where aggression 
      is mostly from male to female with the goal of control and domination, instilling fear.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Violent resistance:</strong> occurs when a partner resists aggression, 
      often in self-defense, and can lead to injury.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Situational couple violence / common couple violence:</strong> involves 
      bidirectional, low-intensity aggression, often because of conflict rather than 
      for control or self-defense.
    </li>
  </ul>
